### About Me
<br>
Hello and welcome to my profile! I'm Kyle and I am currently studying for a level 5 diploma in full stack web devlopment course at Code Institute!
I have always had an inquisitive mind, which led me to obtain an MSc in Stem Cell Biology. However I wanted to apply more of my problem solving and creative passion into a job that I love. From what I have learnt so far, coding does just that!

Outside of the work environment I love to get creative by recording DJ mixes as well as producing my own music. I am currently learning how to create audiovisual art with code. One of my major passions is travelling the world, with 40 countires ticked off the map so far!
